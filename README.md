Hi! Im Jack MacDonald!

This is my TinyApp School Project under LightHouseLabs!

The function of this web app is to take a long url from the webside client via a form, associate a unique 6 character ID with it and store it in a database. Phonebook style! 
Users are able to register / login by supplying a Email and Password.

WARNING: LOW SECURITY MESURES ON THIS APP, DO NOT STORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND/OR PERSONAL PASSWORDS.

This app is dependant on Express, Cookie-Parser and EJS to run
