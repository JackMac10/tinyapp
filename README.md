# tinyapp

Hi! Im Jack MacDonald!

This is my TinyApp Project under LightHouseLabs! TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

# TinyApp Project

The function of this web app is to take a url from the webside client via a form, associate and store a unique 6 character ID with it and allow you to directly call or be redirected to the site instantly! Phonebook style! 
Users must register and/or login by supplying a Email and Password to veiw their saved urls.

WARNING: LOW SECURITY MESURES ON THIS APP, DO NOT STORE SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND/OR PERSONAL PASSWORDS.

This app is dependant on Express, Cookie-Parser and EJS to run
